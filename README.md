Here is your source for questions: [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). 

### App Requirements:
- The app should integrate with the Open Trivia Database API to fetch trivia questions.
- Users should have the ability to select the quiz category, difficulty level, and the number of questions. It is up to you as a developer if you want to display multiple-choice questions only or single-choice ones. You can hardcode that choice in the API request.
- Users should be able to start the quiz once they have configured their preferences.
- The app should implement a multi-step wizard-like flow for the quiz, i.e should display a single question at a time. 
- Users should be able to navigate between questions using forward and backward buttons (browser buttons).
- The current progress of the quiz should be displayed, indicating the number of completed questions and the total number of questions.
- The app should handle errors gracefully and display meaningful error messages to the user.
- Once the user completes all the questions, the app should display a summary of their results. The summary should include the user's score, the number of correct and incorrect answers, and the percentage of correct answers.
- Users should have the option to review their answers and see the correct answers for the questions they answered incorrectly.
- BONUS: Include a timer to limit the time for each question or for the entire quiz. Include the remaining time in the score calculation.
- BONUS: Write end-to-end tests with Cypress.
- BONUS: Make the app pretty & responsive with Chakra UI (there will be a lecture on that).
